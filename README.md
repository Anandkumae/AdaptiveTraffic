# AdaptiveTraffic
An **Adaptive Traffic Signal System (ATSS)** optimizes signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions using sensors and algorithms. Unlike fixed signals, it adjusts green light durations to reduce congestion and delays. Machine learning can enhance predictions, ensuring smoother traffic flow and better efficiency.
